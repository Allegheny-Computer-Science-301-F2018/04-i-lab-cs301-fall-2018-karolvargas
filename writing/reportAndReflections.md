Question 7.
Looking at the source provided in the link below another disease that we can see that has a positive impact from vaccines would be tuberculosis. The deaths from before Vaccines to today have decreased per year by 600,000. That is a monumental difference. Another disease that has had a
huge drop in deaths from before vaccines was tetanus that we see a drop of 300,000 deaths per year. It is clear from this that although some vaccines arguably may or may not have side effects the chance to
be safe from death is far outweighs the chance of allegedly getting autism.

Question 8.
The damage that occurs is people who don't have access to correct information would take this article literally and not give their child a vaccine. Then if this child does not get vaccinated that means that there is a greater chance that this child and many other children could lose their lives because
of this false article. Academic research groups should be able to peer review claims with science before any newspaper is allowed to print to avoid this type of situation. This is not enough to fix the damage and nothing could fix the damage because once someone sees something like that they are telling everyone and that could lead to just more and more children at risk of death.

Question 10.
I thought the talk was very interesting seeing how people work with data everyday and how data mining and finding data points is so important in business and health. I thought it was very interesting how
Dr. Finaret discussed how finding a target age and target audience can save a ton of money on advertising with new initiatives in social media marketing. I also thought it was interesting how this could affect the global health market knowing what medicines are good and bad.
